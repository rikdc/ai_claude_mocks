# Reliable Mock Generation Approaches: What Actually Works

This document provides an honest comparison of approaches to reliable mock generation for AI agents, based on working implementations and real-world testing in the `examples/` directory.

## Executive Summary

After building and testing all approaches, here's what actually works:

| Approach | Complexity | Reliability | Token Efficiency | Best For |
|----------|------------|-------------|------------------|----------|
| **Prompt-Only** | Low | Medium | Poor | Learning, Prototypes |
| **Command-Line** | Medium | High | Medium | Development Teams |
| **Makefile** | Low | High | Excellent | Most Teams (Winner) |
